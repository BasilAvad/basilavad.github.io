At first, I started out in my bachelors studies at TU Delft at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. Here are just some snippets from some of my projects!

# Bachelor Final Project

For the bachelor final project, the assignment was given by John Doe Amsterdam, the Creator of the John's phone. It was the answer against the smartphones at that time.

We were supposed to come up with a new product for their portfolio. My contribution at that time was the John's camera, a clip-on time-lapse camera.
